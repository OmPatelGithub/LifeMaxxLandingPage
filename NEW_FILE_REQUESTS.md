# New File Request: index.html (Landing Page Redesign)

## Description

Redesign the existing `index.html` to serve as a modern, responsive landing page for the LifeMaxx iPhone app, inspired by the RIZZ landing page. The new design will include:

- Centered app name and tagline
- Download buttons for App Store and Google Play
- Footer with support, press, terms, privacy, and social links
- Modern, dark background and clean layout

## Duplicate Functionality Search

I searched the following for existing or duplicate landing page functionality:

- `index.html`: Contains a basic landing page, but not in the desired style or with required features.
- All files in the project root (no other HTML or landing-related files found).
- `.git` directory: No relevant files.
- Searched for filenames containing 'landing', 'home', 'app', 'main' (no results).
- Searched for keywords: 'landing', 'LifeMaxx', 'app store', 'google play', 'iphone', 'android', 'download', 'support', 'press', 'terms', 'privacy', 'footer', 'social', 'twitter', 'instagram', 'tiktok', 'facebook' (no relevant code found).

No duplicate or conflicting landing page functionality exists. Proceeding with the redesign in `index.html`.
